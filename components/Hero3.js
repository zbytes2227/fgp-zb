            Feroze Gandhi was an Indian politician, journalist, and a key figure
            in the Indian National Congress. Born on September 12, 1912, in
            Bombay (present-day Mumbai), Feroze Gandhi was the husband of former
            Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the father of Rajiv Gandhi, who
            also became the Prime Minister of India. Feroze Gandhi initially
            worked as a journalist and later entered politics. He served as a
            Member of Parliament (MP) and made significant contributions to the
            political landscape. Feroze Gandhi is remembered for his efforts in
            exposing corruption, particularly through his investigation of the
            Mundhra scandal, which led to his reputation as a crusader against
            corruption in public life. His untimely death at the age of 48 in
            1960 marked the end of a promising political career. Feroze Gandhi
            is remembered for his advocacy for transparency and ethical
            governance in Indian politics, leaving a lasting impact on the
            countrys political discourse.
